              In 2002, the third-generation model was introduced, which saw the model move further up-market. Planned and developed under BMW ownership the third generation was to share components and systems (electronics, core power units etc.) with the BMW 7 Series (E38). It was designed to accommodate BMW's 4.4 litre M62 V8 engines for future models. The manual transmission was dropped entirely, leaving only the automatic. The 7 Series electronics system was being phased out during the development of the third-generation Range Rover and being replaced with the electronics from the BMW 5 Series (E39). Note that there were three "Generations" of the L322, from 2002 until 2005 was the aforementioned M62 BMW V8 with ZF 5HP-24 transmission, going along to 2006 until 2009 a 4.4-litre Jaguar derived engine alongside a 4.2-litre supercharged variant of the Jag engine partnered with the ZF 6HP-26 transmission. In 2010 Land Rover fitted the newly designed 5.0 N/A and Supercharged engine with ZF 6HP-26 until the 2012 model year, which saw the end of the L322 production. This list does not give diesel options.
              From 2002-2004 the L322 saw a standard BMW E39 electrics system. From 2005-2009 the L322 saw an updated Jaguar derived electrics system with fibre optics and Bluetooth. From 2010-2012 the L322 saw an updated (different from 05-09) Jaguar derived electrics, the first "modern feeling" system.
              In MY06 the first exterior update was applied with a slight face-lift of front fascia, tail lamps. Some other slight differences can be found on the "Supercharged" variant. The second exterior update was in 2010, bringing a true modern feel to the L322 with new fascia, tail lamps, side grills, and clear side markers.
              The interiors had stayed relatively the same with exclusions ie. Supercharged trim black piano finish until 2006.5, (NAS 2007) where an updated interior was brought. Another major change was in 2010.
